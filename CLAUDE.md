# Claude Ads: Paid Advertising Audit & Optimization Skill

## Project Overview

This repository contains **Claude Ads**, a Tier 4 Claude Code skill for comprehensive
paid advertising analysis across all major platforms. It follows the Agent Skills open
standard and the 3-layer architecture (directive, orchestration, execution). 22 sub-skills,
10 agents (6 audit + 4 creative), and 12 industry templates cover Google, Meta, YouTube, LinkedIn,
TikTok, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon Ads with 250+ weighted audit checks, plus cross-platform
attribution and server-side tracking deep dives.

## Development Rules

- Keep SKILL.md files under 500 lines / 5000 tokens
- Reference files should be focused; aim for under 350 lines. Split when a
  single reference exceeds that and starts mixing concerns
- Scripts must have docstrings, CLI interface, and JSON output
- Follow kebab-case naming for all skill directories
- Agents invoked via Task tool with `context: fork`, never via Bash
- No hardcoded credentials; use MCP servers for external API access

## Release Blog Post

After cutting a new release (git tag + `gh release create`), run:

```
/release-blog
```

This generates a blog post on https://agricidaniel.com/blog/, handles cover image generation, SEO metadata, FAQ schema, internal linking, sitemap/llms.txt updates, Vercel deployment, and Google indexing.

## Port registry

Every host port used anywhere under `/Users/adam/Projects` — **including this project's** — is recorded in one complete source of truth: [`/Users/adam/Projects/PORTS.md`](/Users/adam/Projects/PORTS.md).

- **Need a port (new or changed)?** Open `PORTS.md`, find this project's reserved range in the legend, and take the lowest unused port in that range.
- **After** adding/changing/removing any port binding (`docker-compose ports:`, `restart.sh`, dev `--port`): add/update the row in `PORTS.md` **in the same commit**.
- **Validate:** `python3 /Users/adam/Projects/scripts/check-ports.py` (errors on unregistered ports and collisions).
